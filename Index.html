      <p>Haarlem is a city and municipality in The Netherlands and also the capital of the province of Noord Holland.
        The city lies on the River Spaarne and in The South Kennemerland region. Haarlem is one of the medium sized
        cities in the Randstad. The municipality of Haarlem includes the city of Haarlem and the western part of the
        village of Spaarn dam. Haarlem is mentioned for the 1st time in a document from the tenth century. In 1245 it
        received city rights from Willem II| of Netherland. By the end of the Middle-Ages, Haarlem had become one of the
        most important cities in the Netherlands. In the Early Modern Period, the city developed industrially as a
        textile city and culturally as a painter's city.

        <h1>Neighborhood Haarlem Noord</h1>
      </header>
      <img class="img1" src="img/haarlemnoord.jpg"  />
      <p>Haarlem-Noord is a city district of the Dutch municipality of Haarlem with more than 56,000 inhabitants. Until
        1927, the area was for the most part part of the former municipality of Schoten. The area just north of Haarlem
        station had already been annexed in 1884. Here, the Frans Halsbuurt and Kleverparkbuurt were quickly built.
        Construction of the Ripperdakazerne was started in 1882. After the annexation of Schoten, the former
        municipality is almost completely built up within 25 years. There are often single-family homes from the 30s,
        40s and 50s of the 20th century. The Rijksstraatweg goes in the middle of Haarlem-Noord towards Velsen. Parallel
        to the Rijksstraatweg is the Cronj√©straat shopping street at the start of the district. To the west,
        Haarlem-Noord is bounded by the Westelijke Randweg, east by the Vondelweg and Spaarndamseweg. The city district
        has three important bus stops; Julianapark, Minahassastraat and Delftplein / Spaarne Gasthuis.

          The foot represents all leg techniques such as kicking and jumping. Kwon (fist). The hand stands for all hand
          and arm techniques such as bumps, blocks, gripping, clamping and throwing. Do (the way). The road is the path
          that you follow while practicing Taekwondo and mainly represents the mental part.</p>
